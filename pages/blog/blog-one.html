                    <p class="blog-post__date">28/10/2019</p>

                    <div class="blog-post__text">
                        <p class="blog-post__intro"><span class="blog-post__dropcap">W</span>hen starting Digital Media and Communications in Manchester Metropolitan University, I had no intentions of becoming a web developer. In fact, I knew nothing about it. What I always have been interested in is creative work such as graphic design, film and photography. In the second year I discovered my new found interest in web-development. It incorporates all of the aforementioned media and more, which is ideal for me.</p>
                        <p class="blog-post__p">As it’s my final year of university, I felt a lot of pressure to learn as many things as I could to make sure that I’m employable, especially since The Manchester Digital Skills Audit 2019 (Manchester Digital, 2019) shows that the two most sought after languages are PHP and JavaScript. In contrast, the report also shows that HTML is the 5th most sought after language which I found very surprising as it’s very basic and a lot easier compared to other languages on the list. This made me feel a lot better because I’m comfortable with HTML and CSS, and I feel that I’m ready to learn some programming languages.</p>
                        <p class="blog-post__p">After talking to some professionals from the industry in a seminar, they made it clear to me that they are not looking for someone with the most skills, and often the graduates they hire don’t completely know HTML. When they hire graduates, they usually hire someone who is keen on learning and is very interested in the field. This pushed me to start attending talks and events outside of university such as FredMCR where I can meet and get to know developers who work in the local agencies. Not only does this mean that I can make connections with potential employers, but I also develop my skills by learning from the talks. I will definitely continue to attend these talks and I will look out for more to go.</p>
                        <h3 class="blog-post__heading">Industry</h3>
                        <p class="blog-post__p">One of the best things about being a web developer is that you can do it anywhere in the world. According to Tech Nation’s 2019 report (Tech Nation, 2019) the tech industry in the UK is constantly growing and has the highest revenue in Europe, which is good to see since I plan on staying in the UK for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, the Manchester Digital Skills Audit states that 74% of businesses hire graduates and 53% of those are hired from the Manchester Metropolitan University, which is almost on par with the University of Manchester.</p>
                        <p class="blog-post__p">I also read up on the types of jobs in web development since there are so many different companies one can work for. I really liked Mark Boulton’s comparison of working for small companies and large companies in Designing for the Web. He described working in a smaller company as being “a big fish in a little pond” as “Being a designer in a small company is fun. You get to see projects through from start to finish and you’re generally involved in all aspects of the design process – from initial concepts through to the finished product.”. On the other hand, he describes working for a large company as being “a little fish in a big pond” and that “You are provided with signed off, prescriptive wireframes that detail every element on the given design – actually leaving little room for any design problem solving. You are a cog in a machine. A worker bee.” (Boulton, no date). Reading this has really put me off working for a large company because I really enjoy the creative process as well as the development process and it’s something I’d love to do professionally, even if it means that the salary is slightly lower. Also, I don’t like the idea of being one of the thousands of “worker bees” that can be replaced easily.</p>
                        <h3 class="blog-post__heading">Final Words</h3>
                        <p class="blog-post__p">After the research and talking to various professionals at events, I’m very excited to start working in the web industry. But before I even manage to find a job, Brexit is something that could significantly complicate my future. My application for the Settlement Scheme has been approved which should allow me to stay and work in the UK as long as I want to, but things can change at any moment. It’s something I don’t have any control over and while it’s unlikely, I could end up having to find a graduate position elsewhere in Europe.</p>
