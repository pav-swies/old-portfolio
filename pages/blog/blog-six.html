            <p>Demonstrator: <a href="https://jamstackforbeginners.netlify.com/">jamstackforbeginners.netlify.com</a></p>
            <p class="blog-post__intro">
              <span class="blog-post__dropcap">A</span>s continuation of my Hugo website project, I looked into making it a JAMstack page and adding a content management to it. In this blog post I
              will explain what the JAMstack is, its benefits and how I set my site up to use it. I will also explain the process of implementing a static contemnt management to a static site. Along
              side of this project, I also created a <a href="https://jamstackforbeginners.netlify.com/">website</a> that helps beginners create their own JAMstack site.
            </p>
            <h2 id="what-is-the-jamstack">What is the JAMstack?</h2>

            <p>
              The JAMstack is a differnet way of serving a website compared to another common stack, for example the LAMP stack
              <a href="https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/what-is-a-lamp-stack/">(Potter, 2019)</a>. A common way of serving a website is by having it live on a server, and every time a user opens the site,
              a request is sent to the server. The server then grabs content from the database, then builds the site and sends it back to the user. In contrast, a JAMstack website does not rely on a
              webserver because it&rsquo;s static. The website is pre-built, and is simply served to the user directly from a content delivery network.
            </p>

            <h3 id="why-is-this-better">Why is this better?</h3>

            <p>
              Since the sites are pre-rendered, the loading times are much faster compared to a traditional website on a server <a href="https://jamstack.org/">(Jamstack, no date)</a>. JAMstack
              removes the need for all of the moving parts a dynamic site requires, like a load balancer, web server, database etc. Not relying on these extra moving parts removes the possibility of a
              security breach on the webservers and databases, and makes hosting much cheaper <a href="https://jamstack.wtf/">(JAMstack WTF, no date)</a>. A static site simply needs to be served from
              a content delivery network. This also makes developing a JAMstack website a better experience. Services like <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> even offer free hosting which
              is perfect for small or personal sites on a budget.
            </p>

            <h3 id="what-about-the-name">What about the name?</h3>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>J</strong>avascript - Used for progressive interactivity. Since there is no server, the scripts aren&rsquo;t ran on the server. The browser acts as the runtime.</li>
              <li><strong>A</strong>PIs - Used for external dynamic data access.</li>
              <li><strong>M</strong>arkup - Used for static content to be generated from.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A JAMstack website doesn&rsquo;t need all of these to be a JAMstack site. Not all websites will have interactivity through JavaScript or external data passed into them through APIs.</p>

            <h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

            <p>Since the website is prerendered, it needs to be located somewhere where a CDN (Content Delivery Network) can access it. This is typically a Git repository.</p>

            <p>
              For my JAMstack site, I uploaded the site to a <a href="https://github.com/pav-swies/pawelswies.com">GitHub repository</a>, then imported it into
              <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>. I used a static site generator called Hugo to make my site, and since Netlify works with Hugo by default, it&rsquo;s very easy to get it
              running.
            </p>

            <h3 id="static-website-generators">Static Website Generators</h3>

            <p>
              Static site generators create their own source files then convert/build them into a static website. SSG&rsquo;s have many very useful features that allow for a more powerful site. There
              are many static site generators to choose from; <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">staticgen.com</a> is a great website with a huge list of SSG&rsquo;s you could use. For my personal
              JAMstack site, I used Hugo and found it to be really good to work with. You can read my blog about
              <a href="https://www.pawelswies.com/using-a-static-site-generator-hugo/">using Hugo here.</a>
            </p>

            <p>
              Again, you do not have to use a static site generator for it to be a static website serverd by a CDN. It&rsquo;s also important to note that just because it&rsquo;s a
              &ldquo;static&rdquo; website, it does not mean that the experience has to be static. Using JavaScript there are many things that can be done to create a dynamic experience.
            </p>

            <h3 id="using-netlify-cdn">Using Netlify CDN</h3>

            <p>
              To host a website on Netlify, simply make an account, then sign in to GitHub and select the repository and branch your site is in. All that&rsquo;s left to do is to give it a name, and
              it&rsquo;s ready. Netlify will automatically give you a domain and your site will now be live.
            </p>

            <h3 id="automated-builds">Automated builds</h3>

            <p>
              Every time a change is uploaded to the GitHub repo, Netlify will automatically run the Hugo build task and deploy the website. The build task only needs to run once, then the site is
              ready to be served.
            </p>

            <p>Here is the log of the most recent deploy of my site in Netlify:</p>

            <p>
              This makes it extremely easy to update the site, since you don&rsquo;t need to do anything to make the latest changes live, just upload them to GitHub which is what one might do anyway
              for version control. Within minutes your live site will be updated.
            </p>

            <h2 id="content-management-systems">Content Management Systems</h2>

            <p>
              Now, in my opinion this is the best part of this whole setup. While not exactly part of the JAMstack, static content management systems are able to add content to your website without
              having to touch any code. It&rsquo;s a a great way to add tons of functionality to you website without having to do much.
            </p>

            <h3 id="how-it-works-1">How it works</h3>

            <p>
              Opposed to a server-side CMS like WordPress, a static CMS is not on a server. For my JAMstack site, I used <a href="https://forestry.io/">Forestry CMS</a> because it natively works with
              Hugo. All that I had to do to integrate it into my website is create a free account and import the GitHub repository of my website.
            </p>

            <p>
              Forestry provides a sleek user-interface where you can see and edit the content (Markdown files) of the website. Whenever a change is saved in Forestry, it pushes those changes to the
              GitHub repository of the site. Now, because the site is connected to Netlify, the automated build is ran and the website is updated within seconds. It&rsquo;s extremely easy and useful
              and I would recommend this to anyone using a static site generator. There are many more static CMS&rsquo;s, <a href="https://headlesscms.org/">headlesscms.org</a> has a large list of
              them.
            </p>
