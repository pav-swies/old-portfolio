                    <p class="blog-post__date">01/11/2019</p>

                    <div class="blog-post__text">
                        <p class="blog-post__intro"><span class="blog-post__dropcap">T</span>his is my first portfolio website and I really wanted it to stand out. I took a quick look on Dribbble and Behance for some initial inspiration and got designing.</p>
                        <p class="blog-post__p">At first, I put together a simple layout which included an SVG illustration, some titles and a couple of call-to-action buttons. While this design was simplistic and pleasing to the eye, I felt that it lacked character. It was very plain and I thought that the layout was boring and far too common. I ended up scrapping this idea altogether and began searching for different ways of laying out web pages.</p>
                        <div class="blog-post__frame">
                            <img class="blog-post__image" alt="website layout design with illustration on the right and information about me on the left" src="../../img/old-homepage.jpg">

                        </div>
                        <p class="blog-post__p">During my search I came across Jane Simmons’ YouTube channel ‘Layout Land’. She uploads excellent videos about creating web layouts using various techniques, but my favourite video was ‘CSS Grid Like You Are Jan Tschichold’ (Layout Land, 2018) where she shows how using CSS Grid, it’s possible to create layouts in Jan Tschichold’s style. It was exactly what I was looking for. I find the diagonal and vertical positioning very intriguing and uncommon on the web.</p>
                        <div class="blog-post__frame">
                            <img class="blog-post__image" alt="Jen Simmons' home page inspired by Jan Tschichold" src="../../img/jen-simmons-labs.jpg">

                        <h3 class="blog-post__heading">Design Process</h3>
                        <p class="blog-post__p">I used Figma for the design process because it’s easy to use, has all the necessary tools for high fidelity prototyping. For me, the best thing about Figma is that it works in the browser and all of the files are saved online. Thanks to this it’s possible to edit your projects on any computer with an internet connection without having to install the program. After many tries, I finally had a design I was satisfied with.</p>
                        <div class="blog-post__frame">
                            <img class="blog-post__image" alt="the final design of my home page that is inspired by Jen Simmons, Jan Tschichold and other Swiss and Bauhaus art work" src="../../img/final-design.jpg">
                            <p class="blog-post__caption">Final Landing Page Design</p>
                        </div>
                        <p class="blog-post__p">The most common problem I came across was that the layout would have to change a lot depending on the screen size. This is because these designs require a lot of white space. Tschichold claimed that the blank white space is just as important as the areas with black type (Tschichold, 1928).</p>
                        <p class="blog-post__p">The cramped space on mobile devices make it hard to create an effective design with a lot of whitespace, but without a lot of scrolling while staying faithful to the original layout on the desktop version. I think that my final layout is a good compromise because it looks pretty much the same whether it’s on mobile or on desktop.</p>
                        <div class="blog-post__frame">
                            <img class="blog-post__image" alt="Old home page design in Swiss poster style" src="../../img/old-design.jpg">
                            <p class="blog-post__caption">One of Old Landing Page Designs</p>
                        </div>
                        <p class="blog-post__p">This design closely resembles Tschichold’s style. It Includes an arrow pointing at the description about me to catch the viewers attention. It makes the most of the widescreen of a desktop page, with the page navigation and titles on the right side, and the description and social links on the left side. Because of this, it would have to change significantly to work on mobile. I also think that these colours made it look too much like Jen Simmons’ Labs page which is why I ended up scrapping this design.</p>
                        <p class="blog-post__p">I strayed a little from the intended style, but I’m happy with the final design. I will definitely try my hand at ‘The New Typography’ style again in the future.</p>
                        <h3 class="blog-post__heading">Development</h3>
                        <p class="blog-post__p">Visual Studio Code is my favourite text editor mainly due to the extension support. ‘Live Server’ automatically refreshes the page when saving the file while ‘Live Sass Compiler’ automatically compiles sass without having to install anything but the extension. This was also my first time using Sass, therefore I didn’t use it to its full potential, but I mainly wanted to use it for nesting to make my code easier to manage and using functions to avoid having to write the colour hex values every time.</p>
                        <p class="blog-post__p">Here is an example of how functions can be used to define colours:</p>
                        <div class="blog-post__frame">
                            <p class="codepen" data-height="265" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="p_swies" data-slug-hash="mddKoRV" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="SCSS Variables">
                                <span>See the Pen <a href="https://codepen.io/p_swies/pen/mddKoRV">
                                SCSS Variables</a> by Pawel Swies (<a href="https://codepen.io/p_swies">@p_swies</a>)
                                on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
                              </p>
                              <script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
                        </div>
                        <p class="blog-post__p">I also used ‘BEM’ which is short for Block Element Modifier. This is a naming convention which makes code easier to read, work with and understand (Strukchinsky, Starkov, no date). I really like this naming convention and ever since I adapted it into my code I felt less need to use Sass’s nesting feature. In fact, I think that I could ditch Sass entirely since I could also use vanilla CSS variable functions for the colours.</p>
                        <div class="blog-post__frame">
                            <img class="blog-post__image" alt="code using BEM naming convention" src="../../img/bem.jpg">

                        </div>
                        <p class="blog-post__p">Here is an example of vanilla CSS variables. It’s slightly more cumbersome than just using the dollar sign in Sass, but it’s still simple:</p>
                        <div class="blog-post__frame">
                            <p class="codepen" data-height="265" data-theme-id="dark" data-default-tab="css,result" data-user="p_swies" data-slug-hash="QWWxPyZ" style="height: 265px; box-sizing: border-box; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; border: 2px solid; margin: 1em 0; padding: 1em;" data-pen-title="CSS Variables">

                                on <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</span>
                              </p>
                              <script async src="https://static.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
                        </div>
                        <h3 class="blog-post__heading">Final Words</h3>
                        <p class="blog-post__p">I learnt a lot during this project. The New Typography has been very influential to the way I approach design and layouts and I will definitely try to design a website in this style again in the future. Moreover, my CSS Grid understanding has significantly increased thanks to the way these layouts are built.</p>
